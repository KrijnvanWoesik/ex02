# HAN SOC Examples for DE10-Lite
VHDL examples for use in SOC class at HAN University of applied Science, Academy for Engineering and Automotive, Embedded Systems Engineering.

# Board support
All projects in this template are configured for the TerasIC Altera DE10-Lite FPGA prototype board.

## DE0-CV
Because of chip shortage the TerasIC Altera DE0-CV FPGA prototype board had to be reinstated to it's former glory. Therfore some projects may contain a folder named DE10-CV with a project for usage with this board.
